# Watch Later

> A better 'Watch Later' list for Youtube videos.

I find it annoying the Youtube's Watch Later list is sorted by added date, in ascending order (i.e. oldest first).  I'd rather see my most recent videos first.  Therefore, programming.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/cullylarson/watch-later.git && cd watch-later
    ```

1. Build the app:

    ```
    $ npm run build
    ```

1. Open `index.html` with your YouTube API key:

    ```
    $ open index.html?key=<your api key>
    ```
